<h1>This is a calculator i made while learning vanilla javascript</h1>
<p>The calculator is made from several button elements and an inputfield.</p>
<br>
<p>I made this little project to further understand the usage of transfering value (information) from one element to another, as well as using said information in functions to change something.</p>
